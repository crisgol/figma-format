# Figma Format

Figma Format let's you format your canvas by grouping them by the names.

## How it works

It will check the names of each layer and group them by the text before the separator (/) and layout nicely by their groups.

## Example

If we have 5 frames named the following

- "Article/List"
- "Article/List"
- "Account/My Page"
- "Account/Settings"
- "Account/Settings".

And formats using this plugin, it will be layouted like this:

| Account/My Page | Account/Settings | Account/SettingsB |

| Article/Detail | Article/List |
